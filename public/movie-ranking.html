<h1>Some of my Fav Movies</h1>
<h2>First three that I can rememeber</h2>
<hr>

<h3>The Prestige</h3>
<p>One of the best as well as under-rated works of Christopher Nolan Till date in my Opinion. <br>
I still watch it at times and realize that I hadn't relized something in any of my Previous watchings</p>

<h3>Ulidavru Kandanthe</h3>
<p>Far from perfect, but Rakshit Shetty first impactful step towards Perfection<br>
I just whole heartedly love this movie. I do acknowledge a lot of it's flaws, but this was the first Kannada Movie that made me realize that even Kannada Movies can be this Thought Provoking</p>

<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>India's Magnum Opus in my opinion. Rajamouli is defintely a premium amidst the mass Directors <br>
This is the perfect blend of the Mass-iness that every Indian enjoys with Overwhelming Perfection in Story Telling, Rajamouli has created a spot such that if it is his movie, it is meant to be a Block-Buster</p>
